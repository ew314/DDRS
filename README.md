DDRS: Detection of Drug Response SNPs Specifically in Patients Receiving Drug Treatment
================================
This repository includes an approach to identify drug-response associated SNPs from clinical patientsâ€™ follow-up data by integrating cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. 

System Requirements and Installation
---------------------------------
Python <br>
pandas <br>
lifelines <br>

---
Relative activity predictor
---------------------------------
this model is trained to predict the relative activity of mismatched sgRNA with its original matched sgRNA.<br>
pre-trained model is https://github.com/ew314/ew314/blob/main/sgRNA_designer/seq2seq_attention/NBT_float_model_120.h5<br>
